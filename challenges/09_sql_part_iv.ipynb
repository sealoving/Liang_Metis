    "\n",
    "2. Who has played the most matches total in all of US Open, AUST Open, \n",
    "   French Open? Answer this both for men and women.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Who has the highest first serve percentage? (Just the maximum value\n",
    "   in a single match.)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What are the unforced error percentages of the top three players\n",
    "   with the most wins? (Unforced error percentage is % of points lost\n",
    "   due to unforced errors. In a match, you have fields for number of\n",
    "   points won by each player, and number of unforced errors for each\n",
    "   field.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint:* `SUM(double_faults)` sums the contents of an entire column. For each row, to add the field values from two columns, the syntax `SELECT name, double_faults + unforced_errors` can be used.\n",

    "*Special bonus hint:* To be careful about handling possible ties, consider using [rank functions](http://www.sql-tutorial.ru/en/book_rank_dense_rank_functions.html)."
