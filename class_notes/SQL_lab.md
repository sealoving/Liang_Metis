# SQL Lab

_Structured Query Language_ (SQL) is a very useful [declarative language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) for working with data. It is usually supported (with some variation) by relational databases. The tutorialspoint [SQL Quick Guide](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-quick-guide.htm) is a handy cheat sheet for a lot of the syntax. As a data user, access to data will usually consist of a more or less complicated `SELECT` statement.

For joining data with SQL, this [Visual Explanation of SQL Joins](http://blog.codinghorror.com/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins/) is quite good. One thing to note is that "join" will also often be known as "merge" in statistical software.

This lab uses the SQL playground provided in-browser by [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/). Click [W3Schools SQL playground](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all) to go straight to the playground.

This is a pre-populated data environment with nothing to install and no risk of breaking anything. The data there is from a commonly-used example database ([info](http://northwinddatabase.codeplex.com/)). Nice!


## Guided

Let's walk through a few examples:

1) Retrieve all Customers from Madrid

```sql
SELECT
    * 
FROM
    Customers
WHERE
    City='Madrid';
```

2) How many customers are there in each city?

```sql
SELECT
    City, COUNT(*)
FROM
    Customers
GROUP BY
    City;
```

3) What is the most common city for customers? (And can you make it easy to find the correct answer?)

```sql
SELECT
    City, COUNT(*) AS count 
FROM
    Customers 
GROUP BY
    City 
ORDER BY
    count DESC;
```

4) What category has the most products?

```sql
SELECT
    CategoryName,
    COUNT(*) AS ProductCount
FROM
    Categories
  JOIN
    Products
  ON
    Categories.CategoryID = Products.CategoryID
GROUP BY
    CategoryName
ORDER BY 
    ProductCount DESC;
```


## Practice

 * Which customers are from the UK?
 
 7 total (not printing out all names here)
 ```sql
 SELECT
	*
FROM
	Customers
WHERE
	Country='UK'
```
 * What is the name of the customer who has the most orders?

Ernst Handel,	10
 ```sql
SELECT
	CustomerName,
    COUNT(*) AS OrderCount
FROM
    Customers
  JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
GROUP BY
  CustomerName
ORDER BY
  OrderCount DESC;
```
 * Which supplier has the highest average product price?

 Aux joyeux ecclÃ©siastiques,	140.75
 ```sql
SELECT SupplierName, AVG(Price)
FROM Products
  JOIN Suppliers 
  ON Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.SupplierID
GROUP BY Products.SupplierID
ORDER BY AVG(Price) DESC
 ```
 * How many different countries are all the customers from? (*Hint:* consider [DISTINCT](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_distinct.asp).)

 21 countries
 ```sql
 SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT Country)
FROM Customers
 ```
 * What category appears in the most orders?
 
 Dairy Products (100 count)
 ```sql
 SELECT
  Categories.CategoryName,
  COUNT(*) AS count
FROM OrderDetails
  JOIN Products ON Products.ProductID = OrderDetails.ProductID
  JOIN Categories ON Categories.CategoryID = Products.CategoryID
GROUP BY CategoryName
ORDER BY count DESC;
 ```
 * What was the total cost for each order?

 OrderID=10372	Total Cost=15353.6
 ```sql
SELECT 
  OrderID,SUM(Price*Quantity) AS OrderSum
FROM OrderDetails
  JOIN Products ON OrderDetails.ProductID = Products.ProductID
GROUP BY OrderID
ORDER BY OrderSum DESC
 ```
 * Which employee made the most sales (by total cost)?

 Employee Name: Peacock,Margaret	Total Sale of:105696.49999999999
 ```sql
 SELECT 
  LastName, FirstName, SUM(Quantity*Price) AS TotalSale
FROM OrderDetails
  JOIN Products ON OrderDetails.ProductID = Products.ProductID
  JOIN Orders ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID
  JOIN Employees ON Employees.EmployeeID = Orders.EmployeeID
GROUP BY Employees.EmployeeID
ORDER BY TotalSale DESC
 ```
 * Which employees have BS degrees? (*Hint:* look at the [LIKE](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_like.asp) operator.)

Leverling,Janet and Buchanan,Steven
 ```sql
 SELECT LastName, FirstName
FROM Employees
WHERE NOTES LIKE '%BS%';
 ```
 * Which supplier of three or more products has the highest average product price? (*Hint:* look at the [HAVING](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_having.asp) operator.)

 Tokyo Traders,	46
 ```sql
 SELECT SupplierName, AVG(Price)
FROM Products
  JOIN Suppliers 
  ON Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.SupplierID
GROUP BY Products.SupplierID
HAVING COUNT(ProductID)>=3
ORDER BY AVG(Price) DESC
 ```
