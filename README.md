# First Week at Metis - Project Benson
  
## A Short and Long Week
A very short week. Time-wise. Our Seattle Winter cohort started on a Tuesday, as the Monday was MLK day. This means that not only we had to cover more contents each day, but also we lost one precious day to work on the first project (due on Friday!). I remember feeling nervous on Monday night and had trouble falling asleep. I partly blame that on shifting my "late-owl" schedule to "early-bird". Living in Redmond, I spend on average 2.5 hours per day commuting to Seattle downtown by bus. Each day at the bootcamp consists of paired programming, lectures, and project work.    

The outcome?  

A very long week. Productivity-wise. At the end of the week, I felt exhausted but fulfilled. I'm not satisfied with the the project work - as always it could be better (see the story below), but I'm happy with the amount I learned and the amount I discovered and feel very excited to learn in the days to come. The paired programing and lectures laid a necessary foundation for the tools and design thinking to be applied in the project, and they were meant to be a starting point. And you will navigate through all the obstacles, with helps just a question away. I normally start by googling the question, and usually finding answers from stackoverflow, other people's github repos, etc. But there are plenty of times I got lost, and the instructors and our teaching assistants would offer immediate help, whether a specific technical issue, , or simply stragigical thinking and brainstorming for next steps. For someone who's normally comfortable in self-learning at home, this made one of the biggest difference for me.   

The cohort?  

This is the other big difference than learning at home. The diversity of the classmates (or, colleagues!) is AMAZING.
