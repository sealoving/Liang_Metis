# First Week at Metis - Project Benson
  
## A Short and Long Week
Our Seattle Winter cohort started on a Tuesday, as the Monday was MLK day. This means that not only we had to cover more contents each day, but also we lost one precious day to work on the first project (due on Friday!). I remember feeling nervous on Monday night and had trouble falling asleep (also partly due to shifting my "late-owl" schedule to "early-bird"). Living in Redmond, I spend on average 2.5 hours per day commuting to Seattle downtown by bus.   

The outcome?
